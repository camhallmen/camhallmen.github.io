        On August 14th, 2018, I began my journey into Web Development. I'm only a few days in, but have already gained an immense ammount of knowledge in this craft. 
        I will continue this course and secure what I hope to be a huge career and quality of life change. I can't wait to list out a wealth of expertise and certificatioins 
        here but until then, I can tell you a little about what I've accomplished so far. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2013, I graduated with an Associate's Degree from the Acadamy of Contemporary Music at the University of Central Oklahoma. Quite a mouthful for a useless 
        academic accomplishment. I had dreams of creating a new heavy metal band and touring the world. I moved to Colorado in pursuit of a good job with which I could 
        gain finances to acrue the music equipment I would need to create such a project. After a while, the job fell through and I was nowhere closer to achieving my goals 
        About that same time, two of my old friends stopped by on a cross-country trip to Florida. They were moving there to start a new business, and a new band. They spent 
        all day telling me about the music opportunities that could only be found in the state, and said I should join them somday. Someday ended up coming the following week.

        I sold my car, hopped into a moving truck and left Colorado. Two days later, I found myself in Florida surrounded by friends and with about twenty five cents in my pocket. 
        We then began the journey of finding new jobs, new places to live and most importantly, new music opportunities. We lived in a warehouse attatched to a friend's business for 
        almost a year. In that time, we were able to make enough money to secure some good-quality gear and an apartment. After multiple failed bands, I ended up playing bass with my 
        friends in On Letting Go. We played all over Florida in this band, and even got a few chances to play sold-out shows with big names in the industry. During this time, I was 
        able to work my way up to Store Manager at the retail location where I was employed. On Letting Go eventually disbanded, and that brings me to the current day, where I sit at my 
        computer with high hopes for the future!
